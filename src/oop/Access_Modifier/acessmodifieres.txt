=> In java, access modifier controls the visibility and accessibility variables, methods and classes.

Types of Access modifiers?
=> 1. Privet : Whatever Privet Is Accessible only Within Same Class. 
   2. Public :
   3. Protected :
   4. Default : (Whenever we do not Provide Access Modifier It Mens we are using default access Modifier )

                            --------------------
   AccessModifier,   Class,  Package,  Subclass (Diff Package),  World (Everywhere)

          Public,     Yes,       Yes,        Yes,                   Yes
          Protected,  Yes,     Yes,         Yes,                    No

                             -------------------

Relationship

1. IS- A
2. HAS-A

1.  IS-A relationship is achieved using oop.Inheritance

Nexon IS-A Car (Child Class IS-A Parent Class)

Class Car{
   void applyBreak(){}
   void startEngine(){}
   }
Class Nexon extends Car{}
}

  Note: When we are using 1 public class in another package we must first import that class.


2. HAS-A (relationship is based upon Usage.):
     => When we have two classes which does not share parent/child relationship then we can create object of
    1 class in another class and that object we can access method variable that class.

Class Car{
   void applyBrak(){}
   psvm(){
      Engine obj = new Engine();
         obj.startEngine();
   }
}

Class Nexon extends Car{

}

Class Engine{
  void startEngine(){  }
}


Sub Class => Child class (using extended keyword)
